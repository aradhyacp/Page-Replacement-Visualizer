# Page Replacement Visualizer

A web-based tool designed to visualize and analyze different page replacement algorithms, including **LRU (Least Recently Used)**, **FIFO (First In First Out)**, **Optimal** and **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**. This tool makes it easier to understand how these algorithms work through interactive visualizations and experiments.

## Key Features

- **Page Replacement Algorithm Visualization**: Visualizes the working of various page replacement algorithms (LRU, FIFO, Optimal).
- **Optimal Frame Size Calculation**: Helps in determining the optimal frame size for a given reference string.
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Compares multiple algorithms and generates performance graphs for better understanding (e.g., comparing page faults over time).
- **Belady’s Anomaly Detection**: Detects when Belady’s anomaly occurs, helping to identify cases where increasing the number of frames results in more page faults.

## Stack

- **Frontend**: Vite + TypeScript (TSX)

- **State Management**: React’s built-in state hooks
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS
